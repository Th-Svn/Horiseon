Line 20: <nav> was added
Line 38 : <section> was added
Line 103: <footer> was added

Step 2 : Adding the alt attributes to images in order for people needing audio help to have a better understanding of the images being used

Step 3: Adding an id element to "online-reputation-management" in order for the website to send us to the right content when we click that button

Step 4 : Reviewing the structure of the HTML elements and making sure they follow a logical structure by adding some HTML comments to make the file easier to read.

Step 5 : Reviewing the CSS code

Step 6 : consolidating the CSS code per class and putting the css declarations in the same order as the HTML tags
